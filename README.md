# Tridion 2013 YouTube ECL Provider #

This is an External Content Library provider which exposes videos from YouTube in SDL Tridion 2013. The first version supports displaying videos from a single specified account, but could potentially be extended to allow search, multiple users, video upload and publishing in future.
